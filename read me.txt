
I decided to delve into Plain Javascript, even though I got excited at the 
prospect of using libraries like React.js or Angular to make it easier to develop  
applications, because of the advice i received online:

"Learning the language first without the fancy frameworks builds character"

"If you don't understand the basics, you cannot use a tool efficiently'
